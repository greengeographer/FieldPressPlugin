# FieldPressPlugin
This is the official repository for the FieldPress Plugin developed by [UBC Open Geography](http://open.geog.ubc.ca). If you would like to deploy FieldPress, you can download the code here. 

This is a beta release so you may encounter problems. If you would like to contribute to FieldPress code you can do so here.

We developed this plugin to help instructors deploy field trips on WordPress installations. 

The original code that we adapted for FieldPress comes from [CoursePress](https://github.com/wp-plugins/coursepress).

A demo website (only student level access, no admin access) can be found here:
